Like page components, layouts support regions.


== Introduction

Parts are leaf-nodes in the component structure. Parts are typically used in combination with forms, and have a vast range of application areas.

== Usage

To create a layout, place a descriptor file in your project, like this: `src/main/resources/site/layouts/<layout-name>/<layout-name>.xml.

Similar to the page descriptor, the layout descriptor supports both schema and <<regions#, regions>>. 

.Sample layout descriptor with three regions
[source,xml]
----
<layout>
  <display-name>3 regions</display-name>
  <form />
  <regions>
    <region name="left"/>
    <region name="main"/>
    <region name="right"/>
  </regions>
</layout>
----

Here is what an empty layout with tree regions might look like in Content Studio's visual page editor:

== Rendering

Layouts can be rendered using your favorite front-end framework. 

Visit the <<../../framework/components#, component rendering>> section for details on rendering layouts with the Enonic Framework.
