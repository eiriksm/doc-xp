== Introduction

Where traditional databases use update statements, XP uses editors. 

Inspired by modern design patterns like Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS), Enonic XP strongly separates accessing and querying data from writing.

Rather than using update statements, or sending pre-defined objects or structures for persisting, Enonic XP uses a concept called "Editors".
Editors are essentially written as code that manipulates one node at a time.

Editors are typically combined with a query that determines which nodes to modify.
