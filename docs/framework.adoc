Enonic XP ships with a flexible JavaScript MVC framework for server-side execution.

Here are some highlights:

* *Integrated* with the Enonic applications runtime. Ship and execute JavaScript within your apps
* *Compatible* across all releases of XP within a major version i.e. 7.x.x
* *Supports* request-response, clustered events and and background task execution
* *Multithreaded* for ease of development and effective use of multi-core CPU arcitectures
* *Fast and performant* as JavaScripts are compiled and cached on first request
* *Based on the link:https://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/1.1[CommonJS module specification]*
* *Powered by the JVM* Unlike most JavaScript frameworks, this is not powered by Node.js, but uses the Nashorn scripting engine from the Java Virtual Machine. Next major release of XP is expected to be using GraalJS.
