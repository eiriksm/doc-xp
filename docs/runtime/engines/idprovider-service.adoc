= ID provider service
:toc: right
:imagesdir: media

The ID provider service offers a contextual endpoint for communicating directly with any ID provider.

== Endpoint

The endpoint is located at the root of an application or site's url space as `+/_/idprovider/<idprovider-name>+`.
A live contextual idprovider URL pattern may for instance be: `+company.com/_/idprovider/myidprovider+`

The ID provider itself is added to the context of your site or service via <<../../deployment/vhosts#, Vhost configuration>>.


== Request pipeline

The site pipeline is executed as a subset of the <<../engines#common_request_pipeline,common pipeline>>:

Login:: Fixed endpoint for logging in: `+/_/idprovider/<idprovider-name>/login+`.

Logout:: Fixed endpoint for logging out: `+/_/idprovider/<idprovider-name>/logout+`.

Controller:: All other request paths are routed to the ID providers, acting as a regular controller

== Implementation
