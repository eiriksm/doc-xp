HTTP filters enable pipelined processing of http requests.

== Filters

Filters enable you to step into the request pipeline, and execute code at both request and response of the execution pipeline, possibly intercepting the request directly.
Similar to an <<controllers#,HTTP Controller>>, standalone filters are triggered based on an export.

As such, to make a filter, it must export a `filter` function:

.Minimal filter timing the subsequent request
[source,js]
----
exports.filter = function (req, next) {
    var before = new Date().getTime();
    var response = next(req);  // next(req) hands over the request to the engine pipeline and returns the response
    var after = new Date().getTime();
    log.info((after - before) + 'ms');
    return response;
};
----

.Filter manipulating the request
[source,js]
----
exports.filter = function (req, next) {
  req.requestLogging = true; // Manipulate request
  log.info("Request:" + JSON.stringify(req, null, 2));
  var response = next(req); // Continue request pipeline
  response.responseLogging = true; // Manipulate response
  log.info("Response:" + JSON.stringify(response, null, 2));
  return response;
};
----

.Filter intercepting the request
[source,js]
----
exports.filter = function (req, next) {

    if (req.headers['X-Auth-Token'] !== 'letMeIn') {
        // intercept request pipeline
        return {
            status: 403
        }
    }

    req.headers['Authenticated'] = true;
    return next(req);
};
----

Filters may currently be wired into the execution pipeline in the following ways:
